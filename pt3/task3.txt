python3 Sender3.py <RemoteHost> <Port> <Filename> <RetryTimeout> <WindowSize>
    <RemoteHost> is the IP address or host name for the corresponding receiver.
    Note that if both sender and receiver run on the same machine, <RemoteHost>
    can be specified as either 127.0.0.1 or localhost.
    <Port> is the port number used by the receiver.
    <Filename> is the file to transfer.
    <RetryTimeout> should be a positive integer, representing retransmission
    timeout in milliseconds.
    <WindowSize> should be a positive integer.

python3 Receiver3.py <Port> <Filename>
    <Port> is the port number which the receiver will use for receiving messages from
    the sender.
    <Filename> is the name to use for the received file to save on the local
    disk. For example: python3 Receiver3.py 54321 rfile

Experiment with:
    different window sizes at the sender (increasing in powers of 2 starting from 1) 
    and different one-way propagation delay values (5ms, 25ms and 100ms). For
the 5ms case, use the “optimal” value for the retransmission timeout identified from
part 2. The timeout values for the other two cases should be justified clearly. Across all
these experiments, use the following values for the other TC parameters: 10Mbps
bandwidth and 5% packet loss rate in each direction. Tabulate your results under
Question 3 and answer Question 4 in the results sheet
